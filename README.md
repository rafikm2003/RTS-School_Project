# The Dinos - RTS Game

A real-time strategy game where the player is given control of a small group of soldiers and
his task is to kill all the dinosaurs on the map. 

The dinosaurs have a highly developed decision tree, dependent on the player's actions,
where they will not be indifferent to the attacks of the player's units.

The artificial intelligence of the dinosaurs, which I wrote, allows them to patrol the designated area on their own, in search of player units.

One of the mechanisms to help the player achieve his goal is the selection box, which allows the player to give commands to the multiple soldiers he has selected.

The game was written in C# language via the Unity environment. An open-source character model,
map and some animation elements were used.
